# Cinematch

Cinematch is the ultimate personalized movie recommendation app, supercharged ⚡️ with the power of on-device machine learning and artificial intelligence. Cinematch provides users the ability to get specific about what types of movies they’re in the mood for. No more generic “one-size-fits-all” genre filtering like the big streaming services currently offer. Instead, users can easily curate a custom-filtered GenreMash, filled with movies that match every genre category they may be interested in at the moment. In the mood for a romantic-comedy-thriller? How about an animated-western-adventure? CineMatch puts the power of choice back into the hands (and fingertips) 🙌 of the consumer.

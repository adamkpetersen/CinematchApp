# CinematchApp

Cinematch is the ultimate personalized movie recommendation app, supercharged with the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Cinematch provides users the ability to get specific about what types of movies they’re in the mood for. No more generic “one-size-fits-all” genre filtering like the big streaming services currently offer. Instead, users can easily curate a custom-filtered GenreMash, filled with movies that match every genre category they may be interested in at the moment. In the mood for a romantic-comedy-thriller? How about an animated-western-adventure? CineMatch puts the power of choice back into the hands (and fingertips) of the consumer.
